      description: 'Water levels are perfect and trout are actively feeding. Brown trout up to 18 inches reported near Calico Rock.',
      content: 'The White River is fishing exceptionally well this week with water temperatures holding steady at 52Â°F. Anglers are reporting excellent success with small nymphs and streamers. The recent generation schedule has created ideal conditions for both wade fishing and drift boat trips. Brown trout in the 14-18 inch range are being caught regularly, with several trophy fish over 20 inches reported. Best fishing has been early morning and late evening. Recommended flies include size 18-20 midges, small pheasant tails, and olive woolly buggers. Water clarity is excellent, so use lighter tippets and approach fish carefully. The limestone bluffs near Calico Rock continue to produce consistent results, especially in the deeper pools where larger fish hold during the day.',

Minimal generation is planned for Tuesday through Thursday, creating excellent wade fishing opportunities. Water flows will be approximately 350 CFS during non-generation periods. Weekend generation is scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Anglers should plan accordingly and always check current conditions before entering the water. The consistent flows have allowed aquatic insects to establish good populations, resulting in excellent dry fly fishing opportunities. Pay special attention to the generation schedule as water levels can rise quickly and become dangerous. Always fish with a buddy and wear appropriate safety gear.',

Early morning and late evening sessions are most productive when water temperatures are cooler. Focus on deeper pools and shaded areas during midday heat. The generation schedule becomes crucial - fish during and immediately after releases when water is coolest and most oxygenated. Smaller flies work best in clear, low water conditions. Size 20-24 midges and small nymphs are essential. Consider night fishing for trophy browns that become more active after dark. Stay hydrated and wear sun protection during long summer days on the water.',

The shoals above and below town provide excellent rainbow trout fishing, particularly during low water periods. Local guides recommend focusing on the limestone bluffs where springs enter the river, as these areas maintain consistent temperatures and attract feeding trout. The boat ramp area offers easy access for both wade fishing and launching drift boats. Night fishing can be particularly productive during summer months, with large browns moving into shallow water to feed. Key areas include the Railroad Trestle Pool, Calico Rock Bluffs, Spring River Confluence, and the Gravel Bar below town. Each location requires different techniques and fly selections for optimal success.',

These insects provide excellent dry fly fishing opportunities, especially during evening hours. Look for rising trout in slower pools and eddies where caddis adults gather. Elk hair caddis in sizes 14-16 are most effective, with tan and olive being the preferred colors. The hatch typically begins around 6 PM and can last until dark. Fish are often selective during heavy emergences, so having multiple caddis patterns is essential. This is also an excellent time for beginners to try dry fly fishing, as the takes are often aggressive and visible.',

The spring midge hatches should begin in earnest within the next few weeks, providing excellent dry fly opportunities. Streamers continue to be effective as trout are actively feeding after the winter months. Focus on deeper pools during cold mornings and move to shallower water as temperatures warm throughout the day. The generation schedule has been favorable for wade fishing, with minimal releases planned for the coming weeks. This is an excellent time to plan your White River fishing trip, as crowds are lighter and fish are hungry. Book your guided trips early as spring is a popular time for visiting anglers.',

Pink and orange sowbug patterns in sizes 16-18 are most effective. Fish these patterns dead drift along limestone ledges and in slower pools where sowbugs naturally occur. The key is getting the fly to the bottom quickly - use enough weight to tick the rocks. Sowbug fishing requires patience and concentration, but the rewards are worth it. This technique is particularly effective during midday when other insects are less active.',

Size 20-26 midge patterns are essential, with black, gray, and olive being the most productive colors. Fish are extremely selective during heavy emergences, often refusing flies that are even slightly off in size or color. Long, fine leaders (6X-7X) are necessary for success. Focus on slow pools and eddies where midges concentrate. This is challenging fishing that tests an angler\'s skills, but the satisfaction of fooling selective trout on tiny flies is unmatched.',

Large brown trout are less active but will still chase a well-presented streamer. Woolly buggers, zonkers, and sculpin patterns in sizes 4-8 work best. Fish these patterns slowly along undercut banks, deep pools, and structure. The key is varying your retrieve - sometimes a dead drift works better than active stripping. Don\'t be afraid to use larger flies in darker colors. Black, brown, and olive patterns are most effective. This is an excellent time to target trophy fish, as the largest browns are often caught during winter months.',
