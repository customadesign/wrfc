The recent generation schedule has created ideal conditions for both wade fishing and drift boat trips. Brown trout in the 14-18 inch range are being caught regularly, with several trophy fish over 20 inches reported. Best fishing has been early morning and late evening. Recommended flies include size 18-20 midges, small pheasant tails, and olive woolly buggers. Water clarity is excellent, so use lighter tippets and approach fish carefully. The limestone bluffs near Calico Rock continue to produce consistent results, especially in the deeper pools where larger fish hold during the day.',

The generation schedule becomes crucial - fish during and immediately after releases when water is coolest and most oxygenated. Smaller flies work best in clear, low water conditions. Size 20-24 midges and small nymphs are essential. Consider night fishing for trophy browns that become more active after dark.

Local guides recommend focusing on the limestone bluffs where springs enter the river, as these areas maintain consistent temperatures and attract feeding trout. The boat ramp area offers easy access for both wade fishing and launching drift boats. Night fishing can be particularly productive during summer months, with large browns moving into shallow water to feed. Key areas include the Railroad Trestle Pool, Calico Rock Bluffs, Spring River Confluence, and the Gravel Bar below town. Each location requires different techniques and fly selections for optimal success.',

Elk hair caddis in sizes 14-16 are most effective, with tan and olive being the preferred colors. The hatch typically begins around 6 PM and can last until dark. Fish are often selective during heavy emergences, so having multiple caddis patterns is essential. This is also an excellent time for beginners to try dry fly fishing, as the takes are often aggressive and visible.',

Focus on deeper pools during cold mornings and move to shallower water as temperatures warm throughout the day. The generation schedule has been favorable for wade fishing, with minimal releases planned for the coming weeks. This is an excellent time to plan your White River fishing trip, as crowds are lighter and fish are hungry. Book your guided trips early as spring is a popular time for visiting anglers.',

Pink and orange sowbug patterns in sizes 16-18 are most effective. Fish these patterns dead drift along limestone ledges and in slower pools where sowbugs naturally occur. The key is getting the fly to the bottom quickly - use enough weight to tick the rocks. Sowbug fishing requires patience and concentration, but the rewards are worth it.
