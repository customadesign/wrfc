The recent generation schedule has created ideal conditions for both wade fishing and drift boat trips. Brown trout in the 14-18 inch range are being caught regularly, with several trophy fish over 20 inches reported. Best fishing has been early morning and late evening.

The recent cooler nights have triggered increased feeding activity, particularly in the early morning hours. Streamers are producing excellent results, with olive and brown patterns being most effective. The annual midge hatch is beginning to intensify, providing opportunities for technical dry fly fishing. Anglers should focus on deeper pools during midday and transition to shallower runs during low-light periods. October and November consistently produce some of the largest trout of the year.',

The deep pools below the Calico Rock bluffs hold large brown trout year-round. The shoals above and below town provide excellent rainbow trout fishing, particularly during low water periods. Local guides recommend focusing on the limestone bluffs where springs enter the river, as these areas maintain consistent temperatures and attract feeding trout. The boat ramp area offers easy access for both wade fishing and launching drift boats. Night fishing can be particularly productive during summer months, with large browns moving into shallow water to feed.',

A 9-foot, 5-weight rod is ideal for most conditions, providing the versatility needed for both nymphing and dry fly fishing. Leaders should be 9-12 feet long with 5X or 6X tippet for most situations. Essential flies include size 18-22 midges, pheasant tail nymphs, copper johns, and woolly buggers in olive and brown. Waders with felt soles provide the best traction on the river\'s limestone bottom. A quality net with rubber mesh protects the fish and improves landing success. Polarized sunglasses are essential for spotting fish and reading water conditions.',
